Greetings fellow internet pirates! I am you captain of the high seas, Cpt.Jeevan (argh argh.. Never mind).
Jokes aside.<br>
My name is Jeevan Alok, a software developer from India. This is my personal brain dump disguised as blog. This blog is my attempt to
categorize those ramblings and hopefully make some sense out of it. I write on different tech that I am tinkering with, science fiction stories that trigger my existential crisis (yes, I am talking about ciu lixin's 3 body problem), internet stories that I find interesting and many more.
<br>
I hope the it amuses you and you find it somewhat informative. Drop me a [email](mailto:inventorjeevan+blog@gmail.com) or ping me on socials to connect.
